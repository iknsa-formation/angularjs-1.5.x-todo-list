# A quick todo list with angular 1.5.x

The goal of this todo list is to prepare a few vocabulary for the upcomming angular course located [here](https://github.com/iknsa-formation/angularjs-1.5.x)

Since its just a quick preview there wont be much explanation, we'll just copy and paste a few lines of codes and we'll certainly not go into details here.
